# CurrencyCalculator

I created a currency calculator which converts the value of one currency of a country to another country's currency, this provides the up to date exchange rates of these countries. It's primary function is to convert the amount of one currency to another currency and display the actual value.

The layout of the project was done using Storyboard and UIKit.
The conversion rates data was gotten from ExchangeRate-API using Alamofire for it's networking and also Realm database, a realtime local storage for saving and storing the Exchange Rates data, history of the exchange rates which comes in a graphical view. 
Used SwiftyJSON framework for parsing and accessing the JSON data. 
I did UI testing of the objects using XCTest framework.
The framework and third-party used in the project was installed using Swift Package Manager.
